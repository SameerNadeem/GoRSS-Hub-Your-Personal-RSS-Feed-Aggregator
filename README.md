GoRSS Hub: Your Personal RSS Feed Aggregator

In this project, a web server will be developed using Go to create an RSS feed aggregator. The application will allow users to easily manage their RSS feeds by adding, following, and unfollowing various sources such as blogs, news sites, and podcasts. 

The integration of PostgreSQL will enable the server to connect to a database, with a focus on mastering database migrations for smooth schema updates. The project will also involve exploring the concept of long-running service workers to efficiently fetch and display the latest posts from the selected feeds.

This endeavor offers an opportunity to gain practical experience in combining web server fundamentals with database management and handling asynchronous tasks, resulting in a functional application for content aggregation.
